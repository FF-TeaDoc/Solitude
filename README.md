# Solitude

Hey, this tool is a pretty simple leaking tool for Fortnite updates which watches the API until a new build releases, then exports new cosmetics and stuff from the build.

Shoutout to [FModel](https://github.com/4sval/FModel), as it was where I got the idea for this from about a year ago. Incredible project made by smart people.

This is really straightforward to use, just build it and provide a backup file. 

Don't expect this to be maintained much, I just wanted to spread the knowledge on how this stuff works, and just let it be available for everyone now lol.
